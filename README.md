# GON (Name subject to name)

## A devtool that allows you to use domains on your local machine and proxy them to a server

### Roadmap

- [*] .local and http forwarding
- [] https forwarding
- [] web app and live subdomains
- [] debugging and inspect tools
- [] Setup local dashboard
- [] Add other TLDs besides .local
- [] Park directories
- [] desktop app
- [] development templates

### TODO

- [] Add loading spinners and progress bars
- [] Box link list
- [] Use conf for configs
- []

### Notes

- So it seems the right approach is not editing the hosts file. Need to create a DNS server.
- Acrylic DNS for windows, DNSMasq for \*unix
- Nginx server
- winsw for managing windows services or node-windows npm
